with so many profile like 1200 profile of anime character she learned too much thing and from the user about 5k words and i can't filter all the word and some user made the bot horny for the solution just add on the last `but its not horny` 

this is an example

but you can fix the problem with many other choice this is an example to fix it but you can create unlimited profile idea to don't make her soo much horny or change this aspect this for let the user know about this problem
